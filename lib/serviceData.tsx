					The Potential of Your Loft Space
				</h2>

					Types of Loft Conversions
				</h2>
				<ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[#758195] mb-4 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Velux Loft Conversion:</strong> Cost-effective
						and minimally disruptive, this option involves adding
						Velux windows without changing the existing roofline.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Dormer Loft Conversion:</strong> The most
						popular style, which expands the roof structure to add
						headroom and usable space.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Hip-to-Gable Loft Conversion:</strong> Ideal for
						end-of-terrace or semi-detached homes, converting the
						sloping roof into a vertical gable wall.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mansard Loft Conversion:</strong> A dramatic
						transformation that alters the roof to a near-vertical
						slope, offering maximum internal space — perfect for
						terraced homes.

					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Structural Assessment:</strong> Ensure your home
						can support the extra load of a loft conversion.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Access and Staircases:</strong> Staircase design

					Choosing Tiles for Small Spaces
				</h2>
				<ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[#758195] mb-4 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Size Matters:</strong> Larger tiles reduce grout
						lines and create a more seamless, spacious look.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Light Colors:</strong> Whites and pastels
						reflect more light, making rooms feel airy and open.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Glossy Finishes:</strong> Reflective surfaces
						bounce light around, expanding visual space.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Diagonal Patterns:</strong> Clever layout
						techniques like diagonal tiling can increase perceived
						depth.

					Tiling Tips for Small Homes
				</h2>
				<ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[#758195] mb-4 space-y-2'>
					<li>
						<strong>Keep it Simple:</strong> Minimal patterns and
						neutral tones prevent visual clutter.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Flow Between Spaces:</strong> Using the same
						tile throughout enhances continuity and openness.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Go Vertical:</strong> Tiling walls to the
						ceiling draws the eye upward and adds a sense of height.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mosaic Accents:</strong> Feature strips or
						backsplashes add charm without overpowering the space.
